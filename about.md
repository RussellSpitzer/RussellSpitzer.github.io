# About Russ

![A photograph of a handsome man](/images/HeadShot.jpg)

Russell Spitzer received his Ph.D from UCSF in 2013 after performing a lot of
comparisons of protein binding sites. Following that, he became deeply invested in distributed
computing and involved in several Apache projects. While working at Datastax he became a key contributor 
to the DataStax Spark-Cassandra Connector and also worked on both of those (and other) Apache projects. More recently he has been 
involved with the Apache Iceberg project and has devoted most of his time to data file management and advancing the table format. 
Currently Russell is a PMC member of the Apache Iceberg project.
