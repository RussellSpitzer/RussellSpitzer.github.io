# About Russ

I got my Ph.D from UCSF in 2013 after performing a lot of
comparisons of protein binding sites. Following that I joined DataStax
to get more involved in the Big Data / Distributed Computing Scene. Currently
I spending the majority of my time developing the integration of Cassandra with
Hadoop, Spark, Solr and a bunch of open source technologies. I also am far too
familiar with various cloud vendors.
