# About Russ

![A photograph of a handsome man](/images/HeadShot.jpg)

I got my Ph.D from UCSF in 2013 after performing a lot of
comparisons of protein binding sites. Following that I joined DataStax
to get more involved in the Big Data / Distributed Computing Scene. Currently
I am spending the majority of my time developing the integration of Cassandra with
Hadoop, Spark, Solr and a bunch of open source technologies. I also am far too
familiar with various cloud vendors.
