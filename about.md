# About Russ

![A photograph of a handsome man](/images/HeadShot.jpg)

Russell Spitzer received his Ph.D from UCSF in 2013 after performing a lot of comparisons of protein binding sites. Following that, he became deeply invested in distributed computing and involved in several Apache projects. While working at Datastax he was a key contributor to the DataStax Spark-Cassandra Connector and also worked on many Apache projects. After leaving Datastax he worked at Apple growing the then nascent Apache Iceberg project where he worked on data file management and advancing the table format. Currently Russell working on OSS software at Snowflake and is a PMC member of the Apache Iceberg project, and PPMC member of the Apache Polaris (Incubating) project.Russell Spitzer received his Ph.D from UCSF in 2013 after performing a lot of comparisons of protein binding sites.
